# hello-world
Repository to start digging in the world of coding and github

This is my first github repository. After 20 years without coding, I have decided to revisit my long time sleeping skills. I am currently studying a Data science master and new and powerful features are now available in the programming world since the last time I work on it. Now, it is my time. See me in master-data-science
